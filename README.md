##iti_final_project
This is my final project in iti summer training, 
which is a news application, in which I used onboarding screens and Firebase authentication,
and I got the information that was displayed within the application through Api,
and GetX was also relied on as state management. 
There is a screen to display news and another screen to search for news related to a specific word and a screen for the profile.
